This repo lists some of the projects that I have completed so far in Python, Jupyter Notebook, R and Tableau.

## _Python_
* [IMDB-Crawler](https://github.com/rafaelcgama/IMDB-Crawler): The goal of this project is to scrape IMDB's website and developt a dataset containing at least 5000 movie titles, create a web service that returns this dataset and run some basic statistics.

* [Operation Restore Uber Account](https://github.com/rafaelcgama/restore-my-uber-account)
The goal of this project is to try restore my disabled Uber account by crawling Uber's employee names from LinkedIn and emailing them letter pleading for their help to get my account restored since I wasn't able to accomplish that via Customer Service.
